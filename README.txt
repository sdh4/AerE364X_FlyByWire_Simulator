AerE 364X Fly-By-Wire Simulator
-------------------------------
  * Requires Python and numpy/matplotlib
  * Your model should get saved as "main.py"
    in this folder.
  * See "main_template.py" for a starting point
  * Run the simulator from the command line or Anaconda
    prompt from this folder/directory as:
      "python simulator.py"
  * The simulator will then initialize itself and
    start running "main.py" 
  * Debug by paying attention to any exceptions
    raised and by adding print() calls to your code.
