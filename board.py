# This file defines the pins on the
# simulated Featherboard or Raspberry PI

# Basically, in the dynamic model you can
# access the objects that use these pins
# based on an assumption of what module
# is used to access them

# For example if main.py is using the
# pin named LED with the
# digitalio.DigitalInOut class, then that
# the dynamic_model can access that object
# via digitalio.DigitalInOuts_by_pin["LED"]
#
# Please note that outputs from main.py
# are the inputs of the dynamic model,
# and outputs of the dynamic model are
# inputs of main.py
